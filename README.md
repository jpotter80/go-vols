# GO VOLS!

This repository contains simple programs in various programming languages that print "GO VOLS!" to the console. This project is a fun way to explore basic syntax and project structures across different languages.

## Repository

https://github.com/jpotter80/go-vols

## Languages Included

- [Python](./python)
- [JavaScript (Deno)](./javascript)
- [Rust (Cargo project)](./rust)
- [SQL (PostgreSQL)](./sql)
- [Bash](./bash)

## Running the Programs

Each language directory contains its own README.md with specific instructions on how to run the program. Generally:

- **Python**: Run `python go_vols.py` in the python directory.
- **JavaScript**: Run `deno run go_vols.js` in the javascript directory.
- **Rust**: Run `cargo run` in the rust directory.
- **SQL**: Run `psql -d your_database -f go_vols.sql` in the sql directory.
- **Bash**: Run `./go_vols.sh` in the bash directory (make sure to `chmod +x go_vols.sh` first).

## Contributing

Feel free to add implementations in other programming languages! To contribute:

1. Create a new directory for the language.
2. Add the source code file(s) and any necessary project files.
3. Include a README.md with running instructions.
4. Update this main README.md with a link to the new language directory and update the project structure.

When adding a new language, try to follow the existing pattern of having a simple program that prints "GO VOLS!" to the console.
