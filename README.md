# GO VOLS!

Welcome to the GO VOLS! project. This repository contains simple programs in various programming languages that print "GO VOLS!" to the console. It's designed as a fun way for beginners to explore different programming languages and see how they can accomplish the same task.

## What's in this Repository?

This project includes programs in several programming languages:

- Python
- JavaScript (using Deno)
- Rust
- SQL (for PostgreSQL)
- Bash

Each language has its own directory with the necessary files to run a simple "GO VOLS!" program.

## Directory Structure

Here's how the project is organized:

```
go-vols/
├── python/        # Python implementation
├── javascript/    # JavaScript implementation (using Deno)
├── rust/          # Rust implementation
├── sql/           # SQL implementation (for PostgreSQL)
├── bash/          # Bash implementation
└── README.md      # This file
```

Each directory contains:
- The program file(s)
- A README.md with detailed instructions on how to run the program

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

If you're new to GitHub, here's how to get this project on your computer:

1. Install Git:
   - Windows: Download from [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org/)
   - Mac: Install Xcode Command Line Tools or use Homebrew
   - Linux: Use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install git` on Ubuntu)

2. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux)

3. Navigate to where you want to store the project:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/projects/folder
   ```

4. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/jpotter80/go-vols.git
   ```

5. Enter the project directory:
   ```
   cd go-vols
   ```

### Running the Programs

Each language directory has its own README.md with specific instructions. Generally:

- **Python**: Run `python go_vols.py` in the python directory
- **JavaScript**: Run `deno run go_vols.js` in the javascript directory
- **Rust**: Run `cargo run` in the rust directory
- **SQL**: Run `psql -d your_database -f go_vols.sql` in the sql directory
- **Bash**: Run `./go_vols.sh` in the bash directory

Detailed instructions for each language, including how to set up the necessary tools, are in the respective directories.

## Choosing a Language

- If you're completely new to programming, start with Python or JavaScript.
- If you're interested in web development, try JavaScript.
- If you want to learn a systems programming language, check out Rust.
- If you're curious about databases, look at the SQL example.
- If you want to learn about shell scripting, try the Bash example.

## Contributing

Feel free to add implementations in other programming languages! To contribute:

1. Create a new directory for the language.
2. Add the source code file(s) and any necessary project files.
3. Include a README.md with detailed, beginner-friendly instructions.
4. Update this main README.md with information about the new language.
